            <p>
              Express Cash and Loan, Inc. is a family operated business and has been servicing Madera County since 1988. We are an honest and dependable pawn shop that works closely with the local police department and sheriff’s department. We make loans using anything of value as collateral to help those in need of quick cash. During these hard times, it's hard to find that extra bit of cash just to get by. It’s better to pawn gold instead of selling it outright so that you can use it for other emergencies.<p>

              We offer a variety of services including jewelry repair, custom jewelry work, and the selling of weaponry. Please don’t hesitate to come in and see our stock in person or online. We pawn anything from gold, silver, firearms, electronics, computers, musical instruments, TVs, vehicles and more. Express Cash and Loan, Inc. is reliable and our services are confidential.
